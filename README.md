# EAI: Emotional Decision-Making in LLMs for Strategic Games and Ethical Dilemmas

This repository contains the codebase for the paper *"Emotional Decision-Making of LLMs in Strategic Games and Ethical Dilemmas"* presented at NeurIPS 2024. The study introduces the **EAI framework**, developed to model and evaluate the impact of emotions on ethical decision-making and strategic behavior in large language models (LLMs). 

## Overview

Emotions significantly influence human decision-making. This project explores how emotional states affect LLMs' alignment in strategic games and ethical scenarios, using a novel framework to assess these impacts across various game-theoretical settings and ethical benchmarks. The research includes experiments with different LLMs, investigating emotional biases that impact ethical and strategic choices.

### Key Features
- **Emotional Modeling**: Introduces a structured framework to prompt LLMs with predefined emotions and analyze their influence on decision-making.
- **Game-Theoretical Evaluation**: Examines LLMs' behavior in bargaining, repeated games, and multi-player strategic settings.
- **Ethics Benchmarking**: Assesses model responses to ethical questions under emotional influence.
- **Model Comparisons**: Includes experiments on both open-source and proprietary models with multilingual capabilities.

## Usage

*The code will be available in this repository after the conference.* 

### Framework Components
1. **Game Description**: Defines environmental contexts and rules for various game settings.
2. **Emotion Prompting**: Prepares models with emotional states using three distinct strategies (Simple, Co-player, and External-based).
3. **Pipeline Customization**: Supports a variety of scenarios, including single-decision ethics questions, one-shot bargaining games, and repeated game interactions.
